This is an Android app that demonstrates how to use the Glide image loading library with a custom
model loader to manipulate images (in this case crop and translate images) as they are being loaded, to minimise memory usage.

Contrast this with Glide transformations which result in multiple bitmaps being created for every one displayed to the user.
